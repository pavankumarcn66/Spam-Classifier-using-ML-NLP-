According to an article on Forbes, we produce around 2.5 quintillion bytes of data every day, and these numbers are going to increase up to 5 times in the next five years. Out of that huge amount of data, almost 90% of data is unlabelled and unuseful. It is unuseful because we donâ€™t know how to use it. Here comes the role of data scientist and machine learning experts. A data scientist has all the abilities to convert that unusable data into some useful form so that anyone can understand it.  One of the huge parts from that data is text data whether it is in the form reviews, messages, complaints, and more. At the present time, one of the main tasks is to design some kind of technique using which we can classify the data easily and better understand it. Here comes the role of Natural Language Processing. Natural language processing allows us to understand the text data very well. It gives us the power to classify the text between different categories.
